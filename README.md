Added media query and adjusted spacing for home page

### 3rd and 4th Commit
Currently having issues formatting and programming carousel. Will return to carousel at a later date. Added contact form on contact page that pushes data to an array. Will be trialing with HTML form/method/action at a later time. Next feature will be menu toggle.

### 5th Commit
Successfully added a carousel that iterates through an array of URL of photos. Will have to update css of the photos and location of buttons but it works! May add transitions at a later date. Had to make a function(showImage) that would empty the current div and reappend the next image to make it look like it was changing to the next/previous photo. Buttons were programmed to iterate to next/previous array[i] with an if/else statement. I was able to research a clever way of using the modulo operater instead (currently commented out but it also works!).
